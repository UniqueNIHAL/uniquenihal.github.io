        <h2 style="color: #0099CC; font-size: 24px;">About Me</h2>
        
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            My journey in computer science began with my very first laptop, sparking a deep and enduring passion for the field. To advance my skills, I've undertaken several enriching experiences.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            I've had the privilege of interning with esteemed organizations, including <b>Samasti Forensics Lab</b>, where I delved into digital forensics, and Excelerate, where I interned as a <b>Cyber Forensic Analyst</b>. I've also embraced the world of project management during an IT internship.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            These internships have been invaluable, providing me with a broad perspective on various facets of computer science and helping me understand diverse domains.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            Furthermore, I've honed my skills by leveraging educational platforms like Coursera and Udemy. Here, I've completed courses ranging from computer science to formal business English, contributing to my professional development.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            Notably, I've dedicated the last four years to <b>beta testing</b> for a prominent Minecraft server. This role has seen me test new features, identify over 150 bugs, and play a vital part in enhancing the player experience. Additionally, I've participated in beta testing for Fampay's (Famx) and Surfshark VPN's dedicated IP feature. My enduring interest in computer applications and software designs has driven me to excel.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            Collectively, my internships, courses, and beta testing activities have honed my skills in diverse areas. I now possess experience in <b>Ubuntu OS, email and attachment encryption, Microsoft Office tools, and effective communication</b>. My exceptional performance earned me recognition as one of the <b>top 100 interns in the Mindler internship program</b> and led to my selection as a <b>team lead</b> in both cyber security and project management internships.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            I'm currently enrolled in <b>Harvard University's CS50x course</b> on the Edx platform. This course offers a hands-on approach, allowing me to undertake projects across a wide range of computer science topics. It's an ideal platform for exploring the practical applications of computer science, reinforcing my theoretical knowledge.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
            My ambition is to continue expanding my knowledge in the field of computer science. To achieve this, I've participated in <b>Google Cloud Study Jam and Cyber Security Study Jam</b> and successfully completed two paths, Gen AI and GCCF. I'm also actively working on developing my website and a mobile app.
